## A Monument to your failure and inadequacy!

### First some love

[Tetris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris), is among the best and most popular video games ever made. It's popularity has not waned in the 40 years it's been kicking around the market and its catchy theme song (based on the russian tune [Korobeiniki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris)) has yet to fade from public consciousness. Despite its (totally awesome-ly addictive) intuitive gameplay and killer soundtrack, there is an odd parable to be found in the game of tetris. 

## High Score!

We all know Tetris is the kind of game is effectively impossible to "win". The only winners were those who set the local high score or can prove their Personal Records. Since the high score is the only means by which competition _can_ occur, it is the means by which it _will_ occur. This kind of gameplay puts players at odds with each other (and their expectations of themselves) rather than the game. The coin operated cabinet version of Tetris upped the ante by displaying the high score lists (as coin arcade cabinet video games do). Thus setting the players goals and expectation of gameplay before the pieces even start falling.

## The philosophical part

During Tetris gameplay: a 4 block (tetra, get it?) configuration falls from the top of the screen. It's the players job to put the piece in the appropriate space by rotating and moving the piece left or right. The object of the game is to fit these falling pieces together in such a way that they form rows across the play area. When a row fills up, it disappears, and the entire structure above it moves down accordingly. The gameplay is simple, addictive and intuitive. 

## Scoring points doesn't sound like inadequacy

Here's the point: 
In tetris, the rows (like goals we've reached) disappear upon completion. There is no secret bank of completed rows in Tetris, they just disappear, converted into score. There is no time for reflection, only the lingering pre-occupation on the ever growing pile of things things that need to be managed. From this viewpoint, Tetris is a game of managing obstacles and a quantifiable test of the players organizational skills. In the beginning of the game, the play area is blank. Every piece on screen was placed by the player, every unfilled row a thing to be done. Rows with empty spaces that cannot easily be corrected are mistakes and may compound in the future, ultimately causing your failure tower to reach the top of the screen and end the game.

## Why did you ruin Tetris for me

The good news is this: Tetris is only a game. 

We can press pause on our GameBoys or our Amigas or our TRS-80s or literally almost any device made since those were relevant and look at the score every once in a while. 

The same is, sadly, untrue of real life. It is therefore _imperative_ that we stop and take stock of our world to ensure that we are cataloging our successes and milestones, because unfortunately no one is keeping score for you.
