## March 13th 2020 - August 8th 2021
<!--excerpt-->
As you read this I ask you to remember the countless thousands that have lost friends and family members during the endless summer. 

Since March of last year, coronavirus has become a commonplace topic of conversation in my household. Everyone has an opinion on 
vaccines and masks fnd precautions and for many months optimism was in short supply. Lately our conversations have veered toward
what we're all excited to see on this milestone in our return to normalcy. One thing becomes clear as we talk about this more and
more is that even my children realize that this is only a way point on our long trek towards a return to sanity. As the weather
gets crazier and crazier and the world _literally_ [burns](https://time.com/6087748/wildfires-around-the-world-photos/) or [floods](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2021-07-21/extreme-weather-worldwide-climate-change-disasters) around them.

I remember from my childhood, playing outside until the streetlights came on, going to friends houses and enjoying the salt air
coming in off the bay. Last week, my children told me that being told to stay inside because "the air quality is bad" is something
that my kids and their friends know all too well.

I know that this doesn't seem as put together as some of the other stuff I've written but this statement is something a little
different. I want to point out that for many kids (mine included), August 8th was kind of the end of an endless summer. After
being released from school several months early due to a global pandemic, many children didn't return to physical school for
the entire year, opting instead for a virtually agmented existence. Today is the day that many of our kids are returning to
"real life" for the first time in almost two years...

Our kids really need our help. Let's make things as easy as possible for our children entering school, and let's above all remain
understanding and considerate to the needs of those who don't have the means for self-determination at this time of year: 

### School Kids

Let's not begrudge them their general depression or their anxiety attacks over the things that are happening around them that
they don't feel like they can control... The fact is that if were children with the knowledge we have now, we'd be freaking
out too. And before you interject that our kids don't understand what's going on, consider that they have their own understanding
of how this is shaping the world. Consider further that after you're long gone: their understanding will still be around.
