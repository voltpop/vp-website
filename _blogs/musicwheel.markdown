title: Musical Slide Rule

## In theory: theory and practice are the same...

I've been trying to teach myself music theory for several years now, and if you know me and my absent-minded tool making habit, this should come as no surprise: I've come up with a musical slide rule to quickly transpose and identify keys and chords in both the major and minor scales. I've shared this with a few musical friends over the years and while the reception hasn't been overwhelming, it's been positive enough on the learner level that I feel like I should share the wealth with all my fellow newbs

To create this handy dandy little musical tool you will need:
  * card stock
  * spray adhesive / glue
  * split pin
  * single hole punch
  * scissors
  * printer
  
### Creating your 

1) Download the [music slide rule template](/images/MusicSlideRule.pdf)
2) Glue the image to card stock
3) Cut out each of the circles
4) Punch the holes out of the top disk
5) Punch through the middle of both disks and join them with a split pin.

## In practice...

The music wheel is marked such that the blue arrow points to the key shown and is synonymous with 'I/i' in scale degrees.

I personally find the chord wheel useful when I need to transpose a chord progression to suit a vocalist.

### Common Chord progressions

  * I, V, vi, IV
  * I, IV, V
  * ii-7, V7, I7
