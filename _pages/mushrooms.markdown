## Materials:

* Straw
* Used coffee grounds
* Water
* Wooden Mold
* Blender drill bit
* Bucket
* Mycelium substance

## Process:

1. Boil Straw with enough water to cover all of it, but not much extra
2. Let Boil for about 20-30 minutes or until the water-straw mixture has thicked to the point of having a mushy consistency
3. Add one pot's worth of used coffee grounds to the mixture and allow the mixture to sit for an additional 10-15 minutes
4. Allow mixture to cool
5. Once the substrate has cooled, pour it into a bucket and use a blinder drill bit to mix it together until the Straw pieces are only about an inch long
6. Dump the blended substrate into to Wooden mold and compress with a weight until it holds its shape
7. Let the mixture drain, sit and continue to cool for a few more hours before taking a container of mycelium mixture and placing one piece into every corner and one in the center (about half an inch below the surface)
8. Place in a cool dark area and allow it to sit (moisturizing it every few days)
9. 

## Updates:

### (December 29th, 2022)

* There's currently a white, fluffy substance that goes throughout the entire surface of the substrate, through the bottom and top of the mould.
* We're concerned that it may be a Grey mould, but since it seems to just be a white, fluffy substance we're letting it keep growing.

### (January 3rd, 2022)

* There is still a white, fluffy substance throughout the entire thing, but there's more this time than last time.
* There's no flowering growth yet, and the only actual growth there is is a little green sprout. We believe this is from the straw actually starting to grow, which could pose an environmental threat to the mycelium.
* We're going to keep letting it grow and reasearch more towards if that plant growth is ok.
* The sprouting was a manufacturing issue because the straw didn't get properly processed and there happened to be a straw seed in that batch. We may pull it in order to allow the mushroom to have all of the nutrients, instead of having the straw sprout taking some of them
* Today we're going to add more coffee grounds into the substrate, after pulling the straw sprout

### (January 17, 2022)

* After letting it sit until day 25 (misting every 3 days or so) we haven't seen much progress
* There are a few small mycelium balls around the surface but not many
* We noticed that the bottom of the structure has more growth than the surface and aren't entirely sure why
* There's a thin, mushroom-like stem on the bottom side, which could be a sign that it's sprouting on the bottom
* The mushroom-like stem may be the roots of the Straw plant that we had to pull
