## What we do

Thomas Young, also known as the last man to know everything, passed away on May 10th, 1829. Ever since we've had to rely on networks of trained professionals and specialists to help us do that which we cannot on our own.

Since 1829, knowledge has grown exponentially, so much so that it is now impossible to know everything.
