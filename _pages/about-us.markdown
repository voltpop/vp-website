## Knowledge and Experience
Thomas Young, also known as the last man to know everything, passed away on May 10th, 1829. 

Since then, the amount of knowledge has grown such that it is now impossible to know everything. These days, we rely on networks of trained professionals and specialists to help us do things that we alone, cannot.

We at Volt Populous know that not every business can hire in-house IT staffing. Our mission is to provide world class tech services when you need them, so you can get back to doing what you do best.

From the people who create solutions to the people that use them, our goal is to ensure that everybody has what they need to do their thing.
