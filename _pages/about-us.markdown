## Knowledge and Experience
Thomas Young, also known as the last man to know everything, passed away on May 10th, 1829. 

Since then, the amount of knowledge has grown such that it is now impossible to know everything. These days, we rely on networks of trained professionals and specialists to help us do things that we alone, cannot.

### That's where we come in.
Volt Populous specializes in a wide variety of technologies. We put our industry experience, knowledge, and skills to work, helping you get the most out of your tech spend. We at Volt Populous know that not every business can hire staff to do IT. Our mission is to provide world class tech services on an ad hoc basis.

## People Power
At VoltPopulous, our mission is people: From the people who create solutions to the people that use them, our goal is to ensure that everybody has what they need to do their thing.
