## Professional enabler, amateur musician, and tinkering fool

Drew Foulks (warwalrux) is a human being for both fun and profit. He enjoys spending his spare time, and doesn't _not_ do things.


### Where boredom is, inspiration grows!

An avid tinkerer and remote-taker-aparter as a child, Drew developed an early penchant for technology. Today he spends his time supporting 
the Apache Software Foundation as an infrastructure administrator, committer, and member and putting remotes (and other custom electronics) together.

During his down time, he plays guitar and videogames; writes programs and jingles; loves the oxford comma, sarcasm, and cooking.
