## Professional enabler, amateur musician, and tinkering fool

Drew Foulks (warwalrux) is a human being for both fun and profit. He enjoys spending his spare time, and doesn't _not_ do things.


### Where boredom is, inspiration grows!

Armed with an approximate knowledge of many things, Drew likes to explore concepts and abstract ideas using a variety of media and blogging about himself in the third person.

Drew plays guitar and videogames; writes programs and jingles; loves the oxford comma, sarcasm, and cooking.
