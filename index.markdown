Welcome to the [semi-professional](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewfoulks/) [blog](/blogs/) of [Drew Foulks](/warwalrux/).


**Here be Open Sourcery**

Here you can find the less rambly bits of my thoughts about Open Source technology, life in IT, the Arts and Sciences, and Whatever else I can think of that's worth sharing.


**It's not much, but it's a blog**
